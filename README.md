A Lineman JS Template using Angular, with Bootstrap (less) and Jquery. Also provides some examples and hints for when we forget things!

I have also disabled coffeescript building. The main reason being that we want to stay native javascript developers and coffeescript just provides another level of indirection and you don't get a 1:1 mapping of local files to coffeescript files on the browser so makes debugging more tricky.
